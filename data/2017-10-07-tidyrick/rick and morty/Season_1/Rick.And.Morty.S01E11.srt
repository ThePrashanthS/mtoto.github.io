1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,114
- Bye, mom! Bye, dad!
- Drive carefully!

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,203
Have fun, you two.

3
00:00:03,205 --> 00:00:05,872
Yes, we will have as
much fun as possible on our...

4
00:00:05,874 --> 00:00:07,640
<i>Titanic</i> -themed getaway.

5
00:00:07,642 --> 00:00:09,509
Let's lose the 'tude, please.

6
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:10,977
It's supposed to be romantic.

7
00:00:10,979 --> 00:00:13,980
Speaking of disasters, dad, we
are leaving you in charge, here.

8
00:00:13,982 --> 00:00:15,648
I know, c-can we wrap this up?

9
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,785
Morty and I have some synthetic
laser eels oxidizing in the garage.

10
00:00:18,787 --> 00:00:20,653
Hey, don't blow me off.

11
00:00:20,655 --> 00:00:22,222
I am drawing a line, okay?

12
00:00:22,224 --> 00:00:25,558
Any damage to this house or
these children when we get back,

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,394
and... no more
adventures with Morty.

14
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:29,395
Aw, geez, Rick.

15
00:00:29,397 --> 00:00:30,630
If my mom's the one
who's saying it,

16
00:00:30,632 --> 00:00:32,499
then you know it's pretty
serious this time.

17
00:00:32,501 --> 00:00:33,466
That's right.

18
00:00:33,468 --> 00:00:34,334
Wait. What?

19
00:00:34,336 --> 00:00:36,736
Listen, you have my
word as a caregiver,

20
00:00:36,738 --> 00:00:38,238
everything's gonna be fine.

21
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,907
And if not, like you say, no
more adventures or whatever.

22
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:42,675
It's like that old song

23
00:00:42,677 --> 00:00:44,844
"blomp blomp-a noop noop
a-noop noop noop".

24
00:00:44,846 --> 00:00:46,513
You guys know that song?

25
00:00:46,515 --> 00:00:47,680
From tiny rogerts?

26
00:00:47,682 --> 00:00:48,681
You never heard of it?

27
00:00:48,683 --> 00:00:51,417
You know, the black effeminate
guy from the '50s?

28
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:52,585
No-nobody?

29
00:00:52,587 --> 00:00:53,753
A-all right, whatever.

30
00:00:53,755 --> 00:00:54,687
Look, who cares?

31
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:56,823
Just go on your stupid trip.

32
00:00:56,825 --> 00:00:59,659
Not one thing out of place.

33
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:04,898
Not a single thing.

34
00:01:15,973 --> 00:01:17,766
Well, we're past the
point of no return.

35
00:01:17,792 --> 00:01:19,304
I'm going to have a party.

36
00:01:44,629 --> 00:01:50,629

37
00:01:50,981 --> 00:01:54,047
I found jello.
Can you sneak your mom's vodka?

38
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:55,982
Yes, she does.
I saw it in your laundry room.

39
00:01:55,984 --> 00:01:58,785
Listen, you can't both be in
denial about it.

40
00:01:58,787 --> 00:01:59,452
Okay, bye.

41
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:01,387
Summer, you can't
throw a party!

42
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:02,388
Remember what mom said?

43
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,425
Yeah, if anything gets messed up,
you and grandpa Rick get punished.

44
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:07,126
I'm only a human being, Morty.

45
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:09,028
Rick, tell summer she
can't have a party!

46
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,431
Uh, summer, you can't
have a party.

47
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:13,933
Because I'm having a
party, b-I-I-I-itch!

48
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:15,068
Oh, what?!

49
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:15,835
Rick, you can't!

50
00:02:15,837 --> 00:02:17,904
What do you mean
you're having a party?

51
00:02:17,906 --> 00:02:20,573
Are some glip glops from the
third dimension going to come

52
00:02:20,575 --> 00:02:22,075
over and play cards or
something?

53
00:02:22,077 --> 00:02:22,942
"Glip glop?"

54
00:02:22,944 --> 00:02:24,944
You're lucky a traflorkian
doesn't hear you say that.

55
00:02:24,946 --> 00:02:26,512
Is that like their n-word?

56
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:28,748
It's like the n-word
and the c-word had a baby and it

57
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,516
was raised by all the bad words
for Jews.

58
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:32,518
Listen, I think the three
of us could just, you know,

59
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,621
have a nice time, like
just hanging out, and, you know,

60
00:02:34,623 --> 00:02:35,622
doing a little bonding and --

61
00:02:35,624 --> 00:02:36,623
screw that.

62
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:39,125
This is my chance to gain some
footing with the cool kids.

63
00:02:39,127 --> 00:02:40,493
That's why you party?

64
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:41,527
Boy, you really are 17.

65
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:42,929
Why do you party?

66
00:02:42,998 --> 00:02:45,865
To get wr-wriggedy
wriggedy wrecked, son!

67
00:02:45,867 --> 00:02:49,098
Just keep your Sci-Fi friends
away from my awesome ones.

68
00:02:49,104 --> 00:02:53,802
Yeah, and you keep your awesome
friends away from my canapes.

69
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:57,576
After dinner, <i>Titanic 2</i> will
attach to the rail system near

70
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,979
our replica iceberg, and the
hydraulics encased in these

71
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:02,982
tubes will execute a controlled
sink into the icy depths.

72
00:03:02,984 --> 00:03:07,616
A rail system seems archaic for
an attraction this impressive.

73
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:09,455
Are you sure the ship will sink?

74
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:10,823
I can assure you the ship

75
00:03:10,825 --> 00:03:13,059
will sink, as it has a thousand
times before.

76
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:15,461
It is un-unsinkable.

77
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:16,562
Ooh!

78
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:18,998
Look, it's the line
for the bow!

79
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,502
Jerry, I'd love to just kick
back with a Margarita and read.

80
00:03:22,504 --> 00:03:24,671
Do you mind if I skip the whole
"king of the world" bit?

81
00:03:24,673 --> 00:03:26,806
Well, it's not the
"king of the world" bit.

82
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:28,041
That's Jack and fabrizio.

83
00:03:28,043 --> 00:03:31,544
This is where rose says, "I'm
flying, Jack!" But whatever.

84
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:32,979
I can be the only
one to do it alone.

85
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:34,547
Well, what about her?

86
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:35,515
Excuse me, ma'am.

87
00:03:35,517 --> 00:03:37,817
Would you like to take
my place in line?

88
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:39,552
I, uh -- I could get into
trouble.

89
00:03:39,554 --> 00:03:41,454
We won't tell.

90
00:03:41,756 --> 00:03:42,889
So...

91
00:03:42,891 --> 00:03:45,591
- You're a <i>Titanic</i> fanatic?
- Oh, yes.

92
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:47,166
I've worked here
since it opened,

93
00:03:47,192 --> 00:03:49,062
but I've never been
able to participate.

94
00:03:49,064 --> 00:03:51,397
Happy to help... rose.

95
00:03:53,034 --> 00:03:54,500
I love watching bukkake.

96
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:56,903
I mean, like, I don't know if I
personally would ever do it...

97
00:03:56,905 --> 00:03:58,504
Brad! Hey!

98
00:03:58,506 --> 00:03:59,006
Yo.

99
00:03:59,007 --> 00:03:59,872
Brad is here!

100
00:03:59,874 --> 00:04:01,541
Quick, make my hair look drunk.

101
00:04:01,543 --> 00:04:02,675
Check it out.

102
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:04,043
Tammy's already drunk.

103
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:06,013
Cool.

104
00:04:07,015 --> 00:04:08,548
The beacon was activated.

105
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,549
Who is in danger?

106
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:11,217
Ugh! Grandpa!

107
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:12,752
Birdperson!

108
00:04:12,754 --> 00:04:14,520
I am pleased there is no
emergency.

109
00:04:14,522 --> 00:04:16,222
Oh, there's an
emergency, all right.

110
00:04:16,224 --> 00:04:17,523
A emergency!

111
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:19,692
When's the last time you got
laid, 'pers?

112
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:23,129
It has been a... challenging
mating season for birdperson.

113
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:25,565
Then it's time to get
your beak wet tonight, playah.

114
00:04:25,567 --> 00:04:27,700
Go have some fun out there
birdp-- bird-- birdperson.

115
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:29,936
Oh, man, how many
people did you invite, Rick?

116
00:04:29,938 --> 00:04:31,070
Uh... people?

117
00:04:31,072 --> 00:04:32,940
Mm, six.

118
00:04:34,242 --> 00:04:36,542
Yo! What up, my glip glops?!

119
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:37,544
Oh, man!

120
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:42,615
Oh!

121
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:44,853
Y-y-you know there's a garbage,
right?

122
00:04:47,055 --> 00:04:48,788
Hey, uh, what the hell?!

123
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,090
Ooh. That's why you never
invite a floopy doop

124
00:04:51,092 --> 00:04:53,826
and a shmoopy doop
to the same party.

125
00:04:56,731 --> 00:04:57,764
Oh, oh, g--

126
00:04:57,766 --> 00:04:58,831
oh, that's disgusting!

127
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,266
You guys are in my parents' bed!

128
00:05:00,268 --> 00:05:01,134
Oh. Sorry.

129
00:05:01,136 --> 00:05:02,602
I'm not feeling too well.

130
00:05:02,604 --> 00:05:04,570
I just needed to lie
down for a bit.

131
00:05:04,572 --> 00:05:05,605
Oh. Okay.

132
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:06,806
S-s-sorry.

133
00:05:08,243 --> 00:05:09,275
Oh, my God!

134
00:05:09,277 --> 00:05:10,510
Are you kidding me?!

135
00:05:10,512 --> 00:05:14,013
The thing people don't
realize about the Gear Wars is

136
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:17,583
that it was never really about
the gears at all.

137
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:18,284
Uh-huh. Yeah.

138
00:05:18,286 --> 00:05:19,152
No, no, to-totally.

139
00:05:19,154 --> 00:05:21,287
- Rick, you got to stop --
- Morty!

140
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:23,122
- Have you met gearhead?
- Hey, how's --

141
00:05:23,124 --> 00:05:25,792
Morty here, he -- he would love
to hear all about the Gear Wars.

142
00:05:25,794 --> 00:05:28,861
How familiar are you with the
Gear Wars, exactly?

143
00:05:28,863 --> 00:05:30,963
Uh... Not at all.

144
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:31,964
Oh, boy.

145
00:05:31,966 --> 00:05:32,832
I envy you.

146
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:36,936
Okay, it was about
754 years ago...

147
00:05:44,438 --> 00:05:45,246
Oh, hey, Morty!

148
00:05:45,248 --> 00:05:47,047
H-have you -- have you
met my buddy scropon?

149
00:05:47,072 --> 00:05:48,081
Not again, Rick.

150
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,649
That last guy droned on for
20 minutes, you know?

151
00:05:49,651 --> 00:05:51,717
And meanwhile, the whole house
is being destroyed!

152
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:54,020
Whoa, Morty, this guy's
entire planet was destroyed.

153
00:05:54,022 --> 00:05:55,121
Have a little perspective.

154
00:05:55,123 --> 00:05:57,223
Hey, Rick, squanchy
party, bro!

155
00:05:57,225 --> 00:05:58,691
Aw! Squanchy!

156
00:05:58,693 --> 00:06:00,960
Is there a good place for me
to <i>squanch</i> around here?

157
00:06:00,962 --> 00:06:03,229
Squanchy, you can
squanch wherever you want, man.

158
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:06,666
- Mi casa es su casa, dawg!
- All right!

159
00:06:06,668 --> 00:06:07,800
I like your squanch!

160
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:10,570
Uh, Rick, what exactly
is "squanching"?

161
00:06:10,572 --> 00:06:12,972
Morty, listen -- we've
had a lot of really cool

162
00:06:12,974 --> 00:06:15,708
adventures over the last year,
but it's time to relax.

163
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,311
Yeah, if I relax now, there might
not even be any more adventures!

164
00:06:18,313 --> 00:06:20,146
Jesus, Morty, you're
bumming me out.

165
00:06:20,148 --> 00:06:22,715
Can't we just pretend like
everything's fine for a few hours,

166
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:25,184
enjoy ourselves, and then
worry about all this later?

167
00:06:25,186 --> 00:06:27,086
Yeah, that's easy for
you to say, Rick.

168
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:29,088
You know, you like not caring
about stuff.

169
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,025
You know, wh-wh-what's in this
for me?

170
00:06:35,363 --> 00:06:38,764
For me?

171
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:41,033
Jessica.

172
00:06:41,035 --> 00:06:42,835
Knock it off, slow mobius!

173
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:44,670
Ha ha! Sorry, dude!

174
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:49,075
I'm just trying to show off my
powers, bro!

175
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:50,743
I can't believe she's here.

176
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:52,778
Well, what are you
doing standing here, Morty?

177
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,779
Go. Talk to her.

178
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:57,283
Tonight, the only adventure you're
on is your cusping manhood.

179
00:06:59,754 --> 00:07:01,888
Oh, Rose.

180
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,991
Whee!

181
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:06,893
Is that what I think it is?

182
00:07:06,895 --> 00:07:08,194
Yes, every couple gets to

183
00:07:08,196 --> 00:07:10,897
re-create Jack's drowning at the
end of the movie.

184
00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:11,931
It's so romantic.

185
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:13,900
I can't wait to do
that with Beth.

186
00:07:13,902 --> 00:07:14,901
I don't know, Jerry.

187
00:07:14,903 --> 00:07:16,235
With all due respect, it seems

188
00:07:16,237 --> 00:07:18,271
like your wife may not be that
interested.

189
00:07:18,273 --> 00:07:19,405
Look!

190
00:07:19,407 --> 00:07:21,941
<i>Iceberg, right ahead!
The buffet is now closed.</i>

191
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:24,977
<i>Iceberg, right ahead!
The buffet is now closed.</i>

192
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:26,145
Uh, sir?

193
00:07:26,147 --> 00:07:27,713
There's not a problem.

194
00:07:27,715 --> 00:07:30,216
What do you mean there's <i>not</i>
a problem?

195
00:07:30,218 --> 00:07:33,786
The guidance system isn't putting
us on a direct collision course.

196
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:37,056
This ship is about to completely
miss the giant iceberg!

197
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:38,257
Well, do something!

198
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:39,058
Steer into it!

199
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,529
I'm trying!

200
00:07:43,331 --> 00:07:45,097
It's too late.

201
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:46,265
Ladies and gentlemen...

202
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:47,433
Don't brace yourselves.

203
00:07:48,336 --> 00:07:49,435
No! No!

204
00:07:49,437 --> 00:07:50,436
What happened?!

205
00:07:50,438 --> 00:07:52,772
Their rail system
must have failed.

206
00:07:52,774 --> 00:07:53,439
Oh, my God!

207
00:07:53,441 --> 00:07:55,908
We're not gonna sink!

208
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,844
Totally gonna get
laid tonight.

209
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:00,012
I like your feathers.

210
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:02,915
They are designed to attract
the attention of the female.

211
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:03,783
It's working.

212
00:08:03,785 --> 00:08:06,452
Tammy, I should let you know
I just got out of a highly

213
00:08:06,454 --> 00:08:09,755
intense soul bond with my
previous spirit mate.

214
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:12,458
I'm not looking to get into a
soul bond.

215
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,794
I'm just looking for...

216
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:17,129
I believe birdperson can
arrange that.

217
00:08:17,131 --> 00:08:20,132
Hey, Summer, haven't seen you
at flute practice in a while.

218
00:08:20,134 --> 00:08:22,368
Summer, don't tell me you're
friends with her.

219
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,803
Are you kidding me?

220
00:08:23,805 --> 00:08:25,438
I don't even know what she's
doing here.

221
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,872
Whoa. Not cool, summer.

222
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:28,841
This is a party.
Everybody should be welcome.

223
00:08:31,346 --> 00:08:32,044
Oh, great.

224
00:08:32,046 --> 00:08:33,479
Who invited Abradolph Lincoler?

225
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,781
I thought everyone
was welcome.

226
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:37,450
It's not the same, Summer.

227
00:08:37,452 --> 00:08:38,985
Lincoler is a crazed maniac --

228
00:08:38,987 --> 00:08:41,854
just a misguided effort of mine
to create a morally neutral

229
00:08:41,856 --> 00:08:45,224
superleader by combining the DNA of
Adolf Hitler and Abraham Lincoln.

230
00:08:45,226 --> 00:08:49,295
Turns out it just adds
up to a lame, weird loser.

231
00:08:49,297 --> 00:08:52,832
Rick, you brought me into
this world, a suffering

232
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:56,402
abomination tortured by the
duality of its being.

233
00:08:56,404 --> 00:08:58,004
But I shall finally know peace

234
00:08:58,006 --> 00:09:00,506
when I watch the life drain from
your wretched body!

235
00:09:00,508 --> 00:09:01,907
Whoa. What's up, man?

236
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,843
I have no quarrel
with you, boy.

237
00:09:03,845 --> 00:09:04,343
"Boy"?

238
00:09:04,345 --> 00:09:05,878
What's that supposed to mean?

239
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,179
It's just -- l-look, I-I

240
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:10,016
don't know how you thought I
meant it, but...

241
00:09:10,018 --> 00:09:11,350
Don't look at me, dude.

242
00:09:11,352 --> 00:09:14,153
Look, I'm
half-Abraham Lincoln, so --

243
00:09:14,155 --> 00:09:16,756
So I should get on my knees
and kiss your ass?!

244
00:09:16,758 --> 00:09:18,924
Well, no, but...

245
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:20,259
- You know?
- What do I know?

246
00:09:20,261 --> 00:09:22,762
That the third reich will reign
for a thousand years?

247
00:09:22,764 --> 00:09:23,896
Leave him alone, Brad.

248
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:25,197
Stay out of this, Jessica!

249
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:26,365
Kick his ass, Brad!

250
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:27,433
Kick his ass!

251
00:09:27,435 --> 00:09:28,868
Kick his ass!

252
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,236
Kick his ass!

253
00:09:30,238 --> 00:09:31,203
Brad!

254
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:34,874
Rick!

255
00:09:34,876 --> 00:09:36,811
I just did you a favor, Morty.

256
00:09:39,113 --> 00:09:40,379
Sorry about all that.

257
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:42,214
Rick has some really strange
friends.

258
00:09:42,216 --> 00:09:43,849
Ugh! Brad is such a jerk.

259
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:46,218
He's always trying to prove what
a man he is.

260
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,555
I just want to find somebody
nice and sweet.

261
00:09:49,557 --> 00:09:52,993
Jessica, can I show
you something?

262
00:09:53,895 --> 00:09:56,562
Wow! Look at all this stuff.

263
00:09:56,564 --> 00:09:57,396
Yeah.

264
00:09:57,398 --> 00:09:59,799
This is me and my grandpa Rick's
Sci-Fi workshop.

265
00:09:59,801 --> 00:10:01,400
Check this out.

266
00:10:03,237 --> 00:10:04,270
It's beautiful.

267
00:10:04,272 --> 00:10:05,905
You know, Jessica,

268
00:10:05,907 --> 00:10:08,407
there's something I've always
wanted to tell you.

269
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:09,575
What's that, Morty?

270
00:10:09,577 --> 00:10:11,577
I think that
you're the most --

271
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:15,549
No, that -- those weird sounds
coming from the closet over there.

272
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:22,254
- Oh, my God!
- Aah!

273
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:23,589
Hey, I'm squanching in here!

274
00:10:23,591 --> 00:10:24,590
Oh, my God!

275
00:10:24,592 --> 00:10:25,925
Oh, that is so disgusting!

276
00:10:25,927 --> 00:10:27,893
Ow! Oh! Oh, crap!

277
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,949
Huh.
Big star in the sky.

278
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:51,317
Oxygen-rich atmosphere.

279
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:52,985
Giant testicle monsters.

280
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:54,587
We'll be fine! Let's party!

281
00:11:02,057 --> 00:11:06,132
d Just shake that ass, bitch,
and let me see whatcha got d

282
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,137
I swear to God,
Morty, if it weren't for the

283
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:12,638
fact that everyone's still
having a blast in there,

284
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,106
I would be so furious
with you right now.

285
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:14,874
Oh, man.

286
00:11:14,876 --> 00:11:15,975
Y-you hear that, Morty?

287
00:11:15,977 --> 00:11:17,943
You really lucked out with
Summer o-on that one.

288
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:20,045
How are you guys not
freaking out right now?!

289
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:22,648
T-the whole house is sitting in
another dimension!

290
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,950
I-I mean, w-what the hell are we
supposed to do?!

291
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:26,819
M-m-mom and dad are
gonna kill us!

292
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:29,655
- I'm losing it here, Rick!
- Relax, Morty, relax!

293
00:11:29,657 --> 00:11:30,823
It's gonna be fine.

294
00:11:30,825 --> 00:11:34,660
All we have to do is go out and
find us some kalaxian crystals.

295
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,063
Oh, shit, mother [beep]!

296
00:11:37,165 --> 00:11:40,232
Kalaxian crystals, Morty, just a
few miles South of here.

297
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:41,500
Okay. Let's go, then.

298
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:43,702
W-w-we got to go get those
crystals right now, Rick.

299
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:44,836
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

300
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,571
Morty, Morty, I-I can't go with
you.

301
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:48,073
I got to hang back and make sure

302
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:49,675
everything stays cool here, you
know?

303
00:11:49,677 --> 00:11:52,678
I mean, who knows what -- what
if somebody breaks something?

304
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,746
Yeah. Me too.

305
00:11:53,748 --> 00:11:54,313
I should stay.

306
00:11:54,315 --> 00:11:55,681
You guys have any aspirin?

307
00:11:55,683 --> 00:11:57,349
Oh, hey, Morty, this is
perfect!

308
00:11:57,351 --> 00:11:58,751
You can take Lincoler with you.

309
00:11:58,753 --> 00:12:00,352
Hey, man, I'm not going
anywhere.

310
00:12:00,354 --> 00:12:02,354
- I'm injured.
- Shut up, Lincoler.

311
00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:05,358
It's the least you can
do for wrecking the living room.

312
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,058
Yeah!

313
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,627
And, Nancy, you should go, too.

314
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:09,695
What? Why -- why me?

315
00:12:09,697 --> 00:12:11,197
Because, uh,

316
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:15,036
you're -- you're so good at
playing the flute.

317
00:12:17,038 --> 00:12:19,004
Sorry for the inconvenience,
folks.

318
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:20,773
We should resume sinking
shortly.

319
00:12:20,775 --> 00:12:23,242
In the meantime, please, stay on
the ship and enjoy

320
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:26,211
a complimentary plate of
James Cameronion rings.

321
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,546
Great. Not only is the
ship not sinking,

322
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:30,882
but now the fourth wall
has been broken.

323
00:12:31,052 --> 00:12:33,385
I am gonna go back to the room
to finish my book.

324
00:12:33,387 --> 00:12:35,054
You should find
that Lucy woman.

325
00:12:35,056 --> 00:12:36,222
But -- but --

326
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:38,224
You see, Jerry?

327
00:12:38,226 --> 00:12:39,725
May I show you something?

328
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:41,193
Had everything gone as planned,

329
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:43,929
this entire area would be
underwater.

330
00:12:44,232 --> 00:12:45,865
I would have liked to see it.

331
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:48,701
This trip has been a "Titanic"
failure.

332
00:12:48,703 --> 00:12:49,768
Get it?

333
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:50,135
Ooh!

334
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:52,705
- Draw me, Jerry.
- Oh, boy.

335
00:12:52,707 --> 00:12:53,906
Lucy, wow.

336
00:12:53,908 --> 00:12:56,976
Uh, this isn't what I had in
mind.

337
00:12:56,978 --> 00:12:58,377
But it's the perfect moment.

338
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:00,646
We've been dreaming about this
for 16 years.

339
00:13:00,648 --> 00:13:01,914
Um, not like this.

340
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,348
Not -- not with you.

341
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,785
- You are gonna draw me.
- Aah!

342
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:10,122
Then you're going to
[beep] me in that car over there.

343
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:14,459
It's weird, 'cause I definitely think
that all men are created equal.

344
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:15,694
But, at the same time --

345
00:13:15,696 --> 00:13:16,662
Okay!

346
00:13:16,664 --> 00:13:18,830
Um, the crystals should be
really close.

347
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:20,065
There they are!

348
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:23,435
Wait. Something's not right.

349
00:13:27,408 --> 00:13:29,108
Get the crystals!
I'll handle the beast!

350
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,176
Prepare to be emancipated from

351
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:32,945
your own inferior genes!

352
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,648
Summer's gonna like me again.

353
00:13:42,957 --> 00:13:44,156
Lincoler, come on!

354
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:45,257
Let's get out of here!

355
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:47,426
Mein journey is over, Morty.

356
00:13:47,428 --> 00:13:52,232
I have something
important to tell you.

357
00:13:52,934 --> 00:13:57,002
d And the gears, they turned
for a thousand years d

358
00:13:57,004 --> 00:14:00,839
d until the dark day that they
stopped d

359
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,374
Rick, I got them!

360
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:04,276
- I got the crystals!
- All right!

361
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:05,978
- You did it, Morty.
- Rick, wait!

362
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,379
There's something you need to
know.

363
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:09,148
I couldn't have done it without
Lincoler.

364
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:12,151
He said that he was really sorry and
that he loves you like a father.

365
00:14:12,153 --> 00:14:13,852
He only wanted you
to accept him,

366
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:16,455
and he hopes that his final act
would redeem him in your eyes.

367
00:14:16,457 --> 00:14:19,158
He sacrificed himself to save
all of us, Rick.

368
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:19,825
He died.

369
00:14:19,827 --> 00:14:22,361
Well, at least he
didn't die in vain.

370
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:24,597
He got these crystals.

371
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,801
And these babies just saved this
lame-ass party!

372
00:14:28,803 --> 00:14:30,002
Wubba, lubba, dub, dub!

373
00:14:30,004 --> 00:14:31,837
Play something.
Somebody, play something.

374
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:34,373
Wait a minute. What?

375
00:14:37,178 --> 00:14:40,079
d Put your right foot forward d
d and your left foot back d

376
00:14:40,081 --> 00:14:42,848
d then slide around d
d like on a nordictrack d

377
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,184
d move to the left d
d step to the right d

378
00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:48,887
d wiggle your elbows, and look d
d up into the light d

379
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:53,826
d it's the, it's the d
d it's the Rick dance d

380
00:14:53,828 --> 00:14:57,596
d it's the, it's the d
d it's the Rick dance d

381
00:14:57,598 --> 00:15:00,031
Slow mobius, hit me
with the clock beam!

382
00:15:04,372 --> 00:15:08,173
d It's the, it's the d
d it's the Rick dance d

383
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:09,908
That's the Rick dance!

384
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,509
All right!

385
00:15:10,511 --> 00:15:11,877
Whoa, man!

386
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,781
What the hell was that?!

387
00:15:15,783 --> 00:15:16,882
I thought those crystals were

388
00:15:16,884 --> 00:15:18,450
supposed to help us get home or
something!

389
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:19,451
What? No, no, no.

390
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:21,086
I can get us home whenever I
want to.

391
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,649
But, listen, speaking
of those crystals,

392
00:15:22,723 --> 00:15:23,889
can I get the rest of them?

393
00:15:23,891 --> 00:15:25,357
I'm starting to come down,
Morty.

394
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:28,227
Crystal kalaxian is a really
strong, but fleeting high.

395
00:15:30,031 --> 00:15:32,031
That's what I think of your
crystals, Rick!

396
00:15:32,033 --> 00:15:33,866
Oh, Morty, you idiot!

397
00:15:33,868 --> 00:15:36,201
Does anybody else have any more
k-lax?

398
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:36,969
B-birdperson?

399
00:15:36,971 --> 00:15:37,569
Uh, squanchy?

400
00:15:37,571 --> 00:15:38,937
Don't squaunch at me.

401
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:41,573
All right, everybody,
party is officially over!

402
00:15:41,575 --> 00:15:42,908
Rick, take us home now.

403
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:46,245
All right, all right, fine,
Morty, you party pooper buzzkill!

404
00:15:46,247 --> 00:15:47,312
Boo, boo! Morty sucks!

405
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:49,381
Boo! You suck, whatever your
name is.

406
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:50,149
Boo!

407
00:15:50,151 --> 00:15:52,083
Morty, you're the worst, Morty.

408
00:15:52,153 --> 00:15:54,420
But these gears just started
turnin'.

409
00:15:54,422 --> 00:15:56,088
Almost finished, Jerry?

410
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,323
Uh, almost.

411
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:01,226
I haven't quite captured your
beautiful eyes.

412
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:02,828
I'm sure it's good enough.

413
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:03,228
Move!

414
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:06,398
Every weekend, Jacks and Roses
have their Titanic experience in

415
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,435
this car, and I
have to mop it up.

416
00:16:09,437 --> 00:16:12,404
The floor drops out to make it
easier.

417
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:13,605
But now it's my turn.

418
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:17,409
We're going to get it nice and
steamy in there, and I'm going

419
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:21,413
to slam my hand on the steam and
leave a nice handprint, and then

420
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:23,982
you're going to love inside of
me.

421
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:25,617
No mess. No clean.

422
00:16:26,887 --> 00:16:27,686
Beth!

423
00:16:27,688 --> 00:16:30,958
Bet you're glad I think
kindles are dumb now.

424
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,326
I can't help but feel a little
guilty.

425
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:36,028
I didn't peg Lucy for a rapist.

426
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,931
What does a rapist
look like exactly, Beth?

427
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:42,000
Is it a slavic man wearing a
denim jacket with a patchy beard

428
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:44,033
and the scent of
cheap champagne

429
00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:46,371
wafting over his
blister-pocked lips?

430
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:48,607
What?

431
00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:50,509
Well, at least you got all this
free stuff.

432
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:53,946
Should be enough to satisfy your
<i>Titanic</i> Jones for a while.

433
00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:56,381
I'm not going to fit.

434
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:58,150
Beth, listen to me.

435
00:16:58,152 --> 00:16:59,318
You're going to get out of here.

436
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,385
You're gonna go on, and --

437
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:02,020
Jerry, just leave the door.

438
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,222
It's not a door, Beth.

439
00:17:03,224 --> 00:17:04,656
- It's debris.
- I don't care.

440
00:17:04,658 --> 00:17:06,024
Just leave it.

441
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:08,127
Yeah. Okay.

442
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:17,636
"Cape fear"!
"Cape fear"!

443
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:21,169
I'm -- I'm doing -- I'm -- I'm going
to do like from "cape fear".

444
00:17:31,046 --> 00:17:32,611
Hey, squanchers!

445
00:17:32,637 --> 00:17:35,722
The party's squanching
on at my place!

446
00:17:37,358 --> 00:17:38,223
Cool.
I'm coming, too.

447
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:38,690
Uh, no.

448
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:41,093
You're not squanchy enough for a
squanchy party.

449
00:17:41,095 --> 00:17:41,994
What?

450
00:17:41,996 --> 00:17:43,695
Nancy told us what a bitch
you are.

451
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:45,097
Guys, seriously.

452
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:45,430
Nancy?

453
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:47,366
Summer, you're a bad person.

454
00:17:47,368 --> 00:17:49,935
All you care about is having
popular people like you.

455
00:17:49,937 --> 00:17:52,070
That's not what
Abradolph Lincoler stood for.

456
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:54,273
Well, I-it was hard to pin down

457
00:17:54,275 --> 00:17:57,810
<i>what</i> he stood for, but it's
certainly not what he died for.

458
00:18:01,112 --> 00:18:05,117
Next time I party, I'm just gonna
focus on getting totally wrecked.

459
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:06,385
You're so wise.

460
00:18:08,389 --> 00:18:10,022
May I assist you with that?

461
00:18:10,024 --> 00:18:11,256
Uh, sure, yeah.

462
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:11,690
Thanks.

463
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:14,526
Morty, do you know what
"wubba lubba dub dub" means?

464
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:17,563
Uh, that's just Rick's
stupid nonsense catchphrase.

465
00:18:17,565 --> 00:18:19,064
It's not nonsense at all.

466
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:21,366
In my people's tongue, it means,

467
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:23,202
"I am in great pain.
Please help me."

468
00:18:23,204 --> 00:18:24,736
Well, I got news for you.

469
00:18:24,738 --> 00:18:26,238
He's saying it ironically.

470
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,039
No, Morty.

471
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:30,075
Your grandfather is, indeed, in
very deep pain.

472
00:18:30,077 --> 00:18:32,144
That is why he must numb
himself.

473
00:18:32,146 --> 00:18:33,245
Come on, um...

474
00:18:33,247 --> 00:18:34,046
Birdperson.

475
00:18:34,048 --> 00:18:35,280
Come on, birdperson.

476
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:36,615
Rick's not that complicated.

477
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:38,083
He's just a huge asshole.

478
00:18:38,085 --> 00:18:41,119
Then why do you care so much
if you are no longer allowed to

479
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:43,088
continue on your adventures
together?

480
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,423
It appears fate has presented

481
00:18:44,425 --> 00:18:47,958
you with an opportunity to free
yourself of Rick forever.

482
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,494
You know what? You're right.
I shouldn't even care.

483
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:52,164
This is probably the best thing
that could have happened to me.

484
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,999
I'm sick of having adventures
with Rick.

485
00:18:54,001 --> 00:18:57,436
My people have another saying--
"gubba nub nub doo rah kah".

486
00:18:57,438 --> 00:19:00,272
It means, "whatever lets you
sleep at night".

487
00:19:01,342 --> 00:19:04,509
Guys, mom and dad are, like,
right around the corner.

488
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:06,144
This is your moment, Morty.

489
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:07,346
Choose wisely.

490
00:19:07,348 --> 00:19:08,680
Tammy!

491
00:19:08,682 --> 00:19:10,849
Caw!

492
00:19:14,751 --> 00:19:18,390
Wow.
We are so screwed.

493
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:19,625
- Rick, wake up.
- Huh? What? Wait? What?

494
00:19:19,627 --> 00:19:20,192
What? Stop.

495
00:19:20,194 --> 00:19:21,760
Rick, you got to do
something quick.

496
00:19:21,762 --> 00:19:23,227
My parents are home.

497
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,496
Uh, all -- all right.

498
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:26,098
All right. Hold -- hold on.

499
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:28,033
Ahh! So good.

500
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:30,835
Oh, my God.
They're walking up the driveway.

501
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,771
- Bring me the thing.
- What -- what thing?

502
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:33,405
The thing. The thing.

503
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:36,141
The -- the -- it's got, like,
buttons on it and lights on it.

504
00:19:36,143 --> 00:19:36,808
It -- it -- it beeps.

505
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:37,509
Rick!

506
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:39,211
That describes everything in
your garage!

507
00:19:39,213 --> 00:19:40,312
Do you mean this?

508
00:19:40,314 --> 00:19:42,982
Summer for for the win.

509
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:45,150
All right, that should do it.

510
00:19:45,152 --> 00:19:46,318
Whoa!
What did you do?

511
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,554
Uh, s-see for yourself.

512
00:19:49,156 --> 00:19:49,821
Whoa!

513
00:19:49,823 --> 00:19:52,057
Yeah, e-everything's
frozen in time.

514
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:54,059
Yeah, and slow mobius thinks
he's all that.

515
00:19:54,061 --> 00:19:56,161
- For how long?
- I don't know.

516
00:19:56,163 --> 00:19:58,830
How long do you guys want?
A week? A month?

517
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:02,467
Can we start cleaning
the house and see how we feel?

518
00:20:26,305 --> 00:20:27,727
- Worst movie ever.
- Dumb.

519
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:30,360
Ooh, boy, what a
waste of time.

520
00:20:30,364 --> 00:20:30,762
Get it?

521
00:20:30,764 --> 00:20:32,331
You know, 'cause it's frozen.

522
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,266
This has been so much fun.

523
00:20:34,268 --> 00:20:35,334
Hey, Rick.

524
00:20:35,336 --> 00:20:38,103
You know, this whole time, I
haven't once heard you say that

525
00:20:38,105 --> 00:20:39,838
"wubba lubba dub dub" thing that
you usually say.

526
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,739
Don't need to.

527
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:42,741
I have a new catchphrase.

528
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:43,675
Oh, yeah?

529
00:20:43,677 --> 00:20:44,743
What -- what's that, Rick?

530
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:46,178
I love my grandkids.

531
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,245
- Aww.
- Psych!

532
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:50,348
Just kidding -- my new
catchphrase is, "I don't give a [beep]".

533
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:54,186
d Just shake that ass, bitch,
and let me see whatcha got d

534
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:57,456
d just shake that ass, bitch,
and let me see whatcha got d

535
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:58,357
Roll credits!

536
00:20:58,359 --> 00:20:59,458
d Just shake that a--

537
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,559
Roll the credits! Go!

538
00:21:00,561 --> 00:21:01,560
d Just shake that ass

539
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:03,228
That's the end of season one!

540
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,629
That's the end, mother [beep]!

541
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:06,898
"I don't give a [beep]" is my
new catchphrase!

542
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,400
[Beep] you!

543
00:21:08,402 --> 00:21:10,402
That's season one! Boom!

544
00:21:10,404 --> 00:21:13,605
Season one up in your face,
mother [beep]!

545
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:14,539
Yeah!

546
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,843
Revenge.
What?!

547
00:21:54,845 --> 00:21:58,653
Party!
Whoo, baby!

548
00:21:59,378 --> 00:22:01,378
Please, stop!

549
00:22:01,955 --> 00:22:03,422
Hey, brah!

550
00:22:03,424 --> 00:22:04,790
I don't understand.

551
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:06,291
Are you enjoying this?

552
00:22:06,293 --> 00:22:07,359
Do you like this?

553
00:22:07,361 --> 00:22:09,795
Yeah, you know it, dawg!

554
00:22:10,864 --> 00:22:12,164
Whoo, baby!

555
00:22:13,189 --> 00:22:19,189
