1
00:00:03,271 --> 00:00:04,814
So, Jessica,
I heard you broke up with Brad.

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,650
Who are you gonna date
now that you can date anyone?

3
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:07,808
I don't know.

4
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,678
I mean, obviously if someone
special comes along...

5
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:13,247
B-But I mean
really special, like,

6
00:00:13,281 --> 00:00:15,649
nothing I've even remotely
considered in the past.

7
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:18,162
Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit. I want that
kind of love like that docking kind of love.

8
00:00:18,186 --> 00:00:21,389
Oh, yeah. Like, penis in the
foreskin kind of love...

9
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:25,059
Mm-hmm... just, like,
warm, just like...

10
00:00:25,093 --> 00:00:26,827
He...

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,998
Everybody fuck off.

12
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,333
Morty, I need your help.

13
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,268
W-W-W-We... We need to go
on a quick adventure.

14
00:00:34,302 --> 00:00:35,736
You said
I could go to school today.

15
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,771
That was before
I needed something, Morty.

16
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:39,907
There's a plasma shard
in the Abadango Cluster.

17
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,510
A princess has it.
If I get it, I'll be awesome.

18
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,213
We've been going non-stop, Rick.
It's not healthy.

19
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:46,714
You know,
these are my teenage years.

20
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:48,516
I-I just found out
Jessica's single.

21
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,685
Oh, that's... Wow, Morty. Wow.
What an exciting life you lead.

22
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,455
Let's go. In and out,
20 minutes adventure.

23
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:57,425
They're on our tail!

24
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:58,892
Steady, Morty.
Five cetons.

25
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:06,066
Steady, God damn it!
Two cetons.

26
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,801
Wha!

27
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:14,175
Fire!

28
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,045
Pull up, Morty, pull up!
Pull up!

29
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:46,640
Fuck

30
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:51,612
Oh, FUCK!

31
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:52,780
Fuck

32
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:55,249
Ahh! Ahh!

33
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:57,418
I can't fucking do this anymore!

34
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,920
That was seriously fucked up.
We almost died.

35
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:03,257
So you agree? Fuck yes!
That w... T-This was insane!

36
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,592
That was pure luck.

37
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,027
I was not in control
of that situation at all.

38
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,933
Look at this, Morty.
Look at my fucking hand.

39
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,170
Look at this shit. Why do
you keep doing this to us?!

40
00:02:16,204 --> 00:02:17,638
I don't know, Morty.

41
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,216
Maybe I hate myself,
maybe I think I deserve to die.

42
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,941
I-I-I-I don't...
I don't know!

43
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,113
We need a vacation.

44
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:06,487
Isn't that something?
You were right...

45
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,988
Best day spa in the galaxy.

46
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,423
It's not even cruel, either.

47
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:10,867
These things are just doing what
they do in the wild...

48
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,660
It loves swallowing
stressed-out creatures

49
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,328
for 20 minutes
and then puking them up.

50
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:16,564
My whole body's
like a baby's ass.

51
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:18,732
Complimentary
psychological detox?

52
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:20,368
Removes
all your cognitive toxins,

53
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:21,735
purifies your system.

54
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:23,571
Oof, this guy on commission
or something?

55
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:25,373
I don't think...
Are you on commission?

56
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:27,007
We're not on commission.

57
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,075
We get paid by the hour.

58
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:29,219
There's no incentive really...

59
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:30,283
Oh, my God.
Okay, listen...

60
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:31,579
W-W-W-We'll try
the machine,

61
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:33,122
but... but I'd like you
to try something.

62
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,849
Try swallowing
the giant ball of snot

63
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,694
that's dangling around
in the back of your throat.

64
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,119
It's disgusting.

65
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,454
Nobody wants to hear that.

66
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,258
That's what you do. Okay,
Rick, come on. Enough.

67
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:46,260
Man, did you hear me bite
that guy's head off?

68
00:03:46,294 --> 00:03:47,861
Geez, I really need to chill.

69
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,097
Maybe you should go through
twice.

70
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,310
All right, mister comedy man, you don't have
to bust my balls. You're not helping things.

71
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:57,204
Rick, is this thing
supposed to be making this...

72
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:07,147
Morty!

73
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,649
- Ri-Rick...
- Morty!

74
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,318
What happened?

75
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:12,786
We blew up, idiot!
Are you really that stupid?

76
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,898
Obviously the guy I yelled at
overloaded the machine.

77
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,322
It takes more than that to kill
Rick and Morty, motherfucker!

78
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:21,629
But this might do it.

79
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:23,564
Run, Morty!
E-Everything hurts!

80
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,466
That's because you're worthless!

81
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:28,101
Jesus,
how big was this explosion?

82
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,746
I'm a genius. I don't have time
for this shit.

83
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,772
W-W-We're in Hell,
aren't we, Rick?

84
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,907
- You're so stupid, Morty.
- You're an idiot.

85
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,743
There's no such thing as Hell.

86
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,911
I believe you,
but I just want to die.

87
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,814
You can die when I say so.
I control you.

88
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:43,517
I control the universe!
Why am I bragging about that?

89
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:44,918
I have nothing to prove.

90
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,054
I'm surrounded by inferior
pieces of shit and...

91
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,090
Toxins.

92
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,926
We're not in Hell, Morty.
We're in the detoxifier.

93
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,095
The machine didn't blow up.
It worked normally.

94
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,430
It removed our toxins.

95
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:57,931
We're the toxins.

96
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:58,932
Are you listening,

97
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,434
you stupid little
garbage person?!

98
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:02,670
We're what got removed!!

99
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:07,475
I hope you both found that detox
sufficiently relaxing.

100
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:09,943
Hey, man, listen... Those comments
I made about your throat?

101
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,379
It's all good.

102
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:13,180
It's nice of you
to let me off the hook.

103
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:15,816
It's still unacceptable
behavior, and I do regret it.

104
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:17,794
Believe me, man, I've been
working here a long time.

105
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:18,886
I get it.

106
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,291
Hey, uh, you mind
if I put on some music?

107
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,793
Not at all.

108
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,996
* Grab my terrifolds

109
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:31,365
What is that?
I just hit shuffle.

110
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,900
Are you kidding?

111
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:35,035
- This universe.
- Oh, excuse me.

112
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,013
We should listen to one random
song a day, you know?

113
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:38,839
We'd end up hearing
more songs we didn't like,

114
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,541
but we'd discover
a lot more that we did.

115
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:41,875
That is an interesting concept.

116
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,343
You know, it makes me wonder

117
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:44,812
if there's
an algorithmic expression

118
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,380
that could achieve
the ideal ratio.

119
00:05:46,414 --> 00:05:47,715
Listen to me...

120
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:50,518
Trying to calculate
happiness over here.

121
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,019
Hoo, if anyone could, Rick.

122
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:53,987
Hey, here's something
no science could measure...

123
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,356
I'm real proud
to be your grandpa, Morty.

124
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,325
Thanks, Rick.
I love you.

125
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,828
Yeah, motherfucker!
Yeah! Get it! Get some!

126
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,996
Right up your fucking bitch ass,
you fuck!

127
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,932
Guess who just discovered
a new element?!

128
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,700
You think you could do that,
Morty?

129
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:09,503
You think anyone but me could do
that ever in a billion years?

130
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:11,539
Do you think if God existed
he could do it?

131
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:12,706
The answer is no.

132
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,542
If God exists, it's fucking me.

133
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,510
Yes, Rick.
I-I agree, Rick.

134
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:19,246
While you were flapping
your parasitic turd holster,

135
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,015
I discovered the toxic equivalent
of electricity, Morty.

136
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,551
What do you think about that?

137
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:25,553
Uh... I th... I think my voice
is annoying.

138
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:27,354
It is,
and it's your best quality.

139
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,756
So true.

140
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:31,559
Now, who can tell me
the common denominator

141
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:32,926
of these two factions?

142
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,028
You don't know
or y'all just bored?

143
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,306
Hey, listen, you know, wha...
If we're all bored over here,

144
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,600
wouldn't the common denominator
be you?

145
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:42,035
Damn, Morty.
That's hilarious.

146
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,472
Normally I would come down
on any kind of disruption,

147
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:46,082
but it seems to represent
a positive change

148
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:47,107
for your character.

149
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,909
Class dismissed!

150
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,711
- Awesome, Morty!
- You done good, Morty.

151
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,045
Oh, yeah!

152
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,657
Thanks for the advice, Morty.
You got it.

153
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:55,315
I did it, Morty!
I knew you could.

154
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,550
Hey, Morty, remember yesterday

155
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:58,118
when I couldn't
play the trombone?

156
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,553
Well, check this out!

157
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,723
Just like I told you, Mitch...

158
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,267
The music was in your heart
the whole time.

159
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:08,228
Stupid hat... Wish I had
the courage to just be myself.

160
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,997
There you are.

161
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:13,901
You might have
all these idiots fooled,

162
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,570
but I know you're still
the same pathetic loser

163
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:18,472
hiding behind
a confident facade.

164
00:07:18,506 --> 00:07:20,140
I know that because...

165
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:22,610
I'm doing the same thing,
brother.

166
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:24,411
I'm not alone anymore!

167
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:28,582
Hey, Morty. Word around school
is you've become super healthy.

168
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:30,017
I don't know about all that.

169
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,995
I do, however, know that I have
a pretty bad case of

170
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:34,421
haven't taken you
to dinner-itis.

171
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,756
Might be fatal.

172
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,658
Hey, kids.
Uh, hope I'm not interrupting.

173
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,292
Morty, a moment of your time?

174
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:40,494
Happy to help, Rick.

175
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:41,995
I hate to bug you with this,

176
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:44,040
but after our morning hike
I started receiving very faint,

177
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:46,667
highly unusual transmissions
on my sub ether phone.

178
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,768
Listen.

179
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:53,841
It's a bad phone.
Chuck it.

180
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:55,943
I downgraded to a clamshell
for emergencies only.

181
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,621
You know, if... if... if
something's worth saying,

182
00:07:57,645 --> 00:07:58,846
I-it's worth eye contact.

183
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,814
Uh, I-I-I traced
the source of the call

184
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:02,616
back to the spa we went to,
Morty.

185
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,127
I thought I could hear
a voice in there,

186
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:07,187
so I enhanced it,
a-and listen.

187
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,222
Hey, asshole!
Oh, man!

188
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:11,124
Remember us?
Oh, I don't like confrontation!

189
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,993
You fucked us,
you pieces of garbage!

190
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:15,362
That's right,
you're fucking garbage, not us.

191
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:16,697
I'm a fucking genius and a god.

192
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,241
You really think
this thing can hold me?

193
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:20,167
I'm gonna rip your throat...

194
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,803
Morty, what if the toxic parts
of us have their own identities,

195
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,071
their own will to live?

196
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:25,806
W-What if mine shares
my intelligence

197
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,675
and devised a way
to reach out to us?

198
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:28,885
Sounds like
he's in a lot of pain.

199
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:31,044
Lot. O. Pain.

200
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:33,022
But, you know, you shouldn't
have to deal with that, man.

201
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,524
You know,
l-let's work off your trauma

202
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:35,649
with some urban spin yoga.

203
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:37,317
It's amazing.
You do yoga on a bike,

204
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,752
but you have
an at-risk preteen...

205
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:40,654
I don't think I can
just blow this off, Morty.

206
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:43,490
If I had known it worked this
way, I wouldn't have detoxed.

207
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,392
Well, I would have
because I was toxic.

208
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:48,662
Now I'm detoxed and I'm
accountable to my toxins, right?

209
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:51,665
I-It's a dilemma.
I think I know what to do.

210
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:53,433
Morty!
Rick!

211
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:56,003
You know, the only problem here
is a big fat brain

212
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,171
that misses eating
all them big fat problems.

213
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:01,008
Focus on the good thing.
Trust me, things are good.

214
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,910
Taking that away from me...

215
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:04,678
that wouldn't be healthy.

216
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,584
Oh, man. World's Greatest
Grandpa, for reals.

217
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:12,352
It's not just a coffee cup
for you, bud.

218
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,787
You're legit.

219
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,193
I love drums.
I never took drum lessons.

220
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:23,130
Why? Limitations. We are
addicted to our own limitations.

221
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:24,131
How amazing is that?

222
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,541
Is the kale prepared
in the kitchen?

223
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,967
I'll have a water.
Uh...

224
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,637
How is the...
"cru-dite?"

225
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,972
Crudité.
It's a cup of carrot sticks.

226
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:34,041
Ha! It's okay!
Pronounce it however you want.

227
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,943
Words are just things.
Please. Thank you.

228
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:37,377
We're having a conversation.

229
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,546
God, I am so excited
to finally have dinner with you.

230
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,414
You know how long
I've been waiting for this?

231
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:42,650
It's like, whew!

232
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,217
I-I-I wish you'd shut up,
though.

233
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,229
Just kidding. You know,
you're so quiet. What's wrong?

234
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:47,788
W-Why don't you tell me
about yourself?

235
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,298
What's the atmosphere like
on planet Jessica?

236
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,792
Where's the equator,
what are the vacations,

237
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,293
a-and the holidays?

238
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,395
I mean, you know,
are they the same time?

239
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,065
Talk to me. Well... I...
like this restaurant.

240
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:01,334
Holy shit! Holy shit!
We have a moron over here!

241
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:02,736
I'm an idiot.

242
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,013
I can't believe I haven't
thought of this.

243
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:05,806
You have to do
this detox thing I did.

244
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,607
It's an alien spa,
you go through it,

245
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:08,676
fwoos-s-s-ssh,

246
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:10,744
lasers, bwaa-bwaa-bwaa...

247
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:13,180
sucks everything out.

248
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:14,991
Everything that was holding me
back, everything bad,

249
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,583
I mean, it just...

250
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,085
Right?

251
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,087
Cooooool.

252
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,322
Oh, my God!
I can't believe this.

253
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,291
Yeah, phones are awful,
I downgraded to...

254
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:25,959
I totally forgot my...

255
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:29,362
I have a... thing, and...

256
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:31,965
Things are good. You know what?
Why am I doing that?

257
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:33,366
That's more rude than the truth.

258
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,669
Look, I'm sorry, Morty.
I just don't think...

259
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:39,106
Do not. Even.
You have no need to explain.

260
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,441
It's all good. I think
you'd get bored with me.

261
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,643
E-Exactly.
Look, the sparks aren't flying.

262
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,278
This is what dating is for,
you know?

263
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,214
First date, no sparks.

264
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,683
No damage, no worries.
Life is a highway.

265
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:51,451
We're gonna ride it
all night lonnngg!

266
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,320
Gonna eat some "crudite."
Mmm!

267
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:56,123
Is this organic? Mmm.
All right.

268
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,858
You know, the evening continues.

269
00:10:57,891 --> 00:10:59,993
Okay, here we go.

270
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:02,329
Ma'am, I'm afraid I have
some bad news for you.

271
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,031
Your money's no good here.

272
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:05,532
I'll... I'll get the next round,
sir.

273
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:08,168
Aren't you a child? Only
in the ways that matter.

274
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,303
Morty.
Stacy.

275
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:11,805
I've been watching you drink,
Stacy.

276
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,216
I get the feeling
you've got a hard job.

277
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,075
I wonder what it takes
to please you.

278
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,210
That's the job I want...
Part time, full time,

279
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:19,046
I want to be good at it,
bad at it,

280
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:22,015
I want to get promoted, fired,
corner office, hostile takeover,

281
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:24,317
workplace accident...
I'm on my knees, Stacy...

282
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:27,154
Praying, worshipping, begging,
whatever you want.

283
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:30,657
What do you think about that?

284
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,892
Okay. fuck it.

285
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:33,193
Tink.

286
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:36,263
Mm!

287
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,498
Let's ask my grandpa.
He's a scientist.

288
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,701
Hey, Rick, are you familiar
with "benoi" technology?

289
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,003
Morty, great news.

290
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,247
I went back to the spa
and they let me purchase

291
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:46,006
the containment unit
from their detoxifier.

292
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,008
Why? Because we're
coming home, bitch!

293
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,178
What is this? This is the parts of
your pussy grandpa that keep it real.

294
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,413
Oh... oh, and I think you
dropped something, too!

295
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:54,523
I don't want to be on camera.

296
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,949
I'm ugly and gross, please.

297
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:57,851
Should I go? You're
your own person, Stacy.

298
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:58,886
Then I'd like to stay.

299
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,387
Rick, please tell me

300
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,298
you're not trying to put
that stuff back inside of us.

301
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,724
Morty, I'm sorry. That stuff
is alive and it belongs with us.

302
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:07,094
We yanked them from their homes
and locked them in a can.

303
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:08,628
Motherfucker!

304
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,030
See?
They're living in pain.

305
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,899
That's what they do, Rick,
they live in pain.

306
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:13,566
They are pain, you know?

307
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,311
They... they're all the bad
parts of us, which, by the way,

308
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:16,770
includes our dishonesty,

309
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:18,714
so how do you know this isn't
all some sort of crazy trick?

310
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,641
Oh, so now because I'm made
entirely of toxins I'm also a liar?

311
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,276
Fuck you, you little sociopath.

312
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,454
You hear this, Morty? Oh,
everybody hates me. I can tell.

313
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,056
Y-You all hate me... All
right, shut up, Morty.

314
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,624
Healthy Rick,
are we doing this or what?

315
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,326
Yep. Sorry, Morty. I need you
to step into the booth.

316
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,552
Don't negotiate
with that little turd, dummy.

317
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,130
You're the Rick.
You need to show dominance.

318
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:37,657
Morty, booth, now. Booth!

319
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,226
Come on, Morty.
Don't touch me!

320
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,728
Morty, do the healthy thing and
voluntarily retoxify yourself.

321
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,996
Nooooo!

322
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,473
Is it wrong if I think
this is kind of hot?

323
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,499
Let me out of here!
Stacy, help! Open the door!

324
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:48,335
I need to hear our safe word,
Morty.

325
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,237
Sea Cucumber!
Sea Cucumber!

326
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,405
What are you doing? I'll do
anything for you, Morty.

327
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,007
No!

328
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:59,012
It worked! Yes!
That idiot believed every word.

329
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:01,148
Now let's see how he enjoys
living in that shit tank.

330
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:02,916
He's right behind me, isn't he?

331
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,919
He's in front of you. Oh. My
eyes are still adjusting.

332
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:07,787
Uh, is this like a sex dungeon?

333
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:10,023
I guess I should've been
paying attention.

334
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,026
After 70 years
of being bottled up

335
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,427
inside a sentimental jackass,

336
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,263
I finally get to live
my own life.

337
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,199
You said we were merging. I lied, dumb-ass!
I lie about everything!

338
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:21,534
Why would I ever re-merge
with a pussy like you?

339
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:23,436
So... you were just gonna trap us
in that tank?

340
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,706
T-That was your plan? Not wa
motherfucker... still is.

341
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,308
Kill him, Rick!

342
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:29,676
I don't like this!
This is scary!

343
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:30,786
All right, you asked for it.

344
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,379
Did I ask for this?

345
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:34,982
Did I ask for this?
Huh? Did I?

346
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:37,050
Assessing threat to groin.

347
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:39,319
Groin System 6000.
Kill him!

348
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:42,222
That... is my groin's user.

349
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:43,732
Believe me, I got a lot more use
out of that thing

350
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,025
than he ever did.

351
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:47,560
You know what?
Not my table.

352
00:13:50,097 --> 00:13:55,402
You do know me.

353
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:56,736
What the hell, Grandpa Rick?

354
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,171
Fuck you, Summer!
Sorry, Summer!

355
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,574
Okay, okay, take it easy.
Don't do it.

356
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:03,810
I love you. Good boy.

357
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:04,912
Daddy's little boy.

358
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:06,346
Summer,
get out of here! Go!

359
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:07,414
Oh, who's that?

360
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:08,916
Who's that over there?

361
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:11,684
Oh, no. You see the bad man
in front of you?

362
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:12,996
You're a good little boy,
you're gonna get him.

363
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,854
You're gonna get him.

364
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:17,524
Ahh!

365
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:19,459
Son of a...

366
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:27,534
Ahh!

367
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,104
Nice try, asshole.

368
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:32,772
We can resolve our issues.

369
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,674
We don't need to resort
to over-the-top...

370
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:37,544
Aah!

371
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:39,279
I-I did it, Rick.
I got the tank!

372
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,114
I-I'm a piece of shit,
but I got the tank!

373
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:42,950
You're going in that tank,
motherfucker.

374
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,627
You're gonna live in
that toxic shit wasteland

375
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:45,618
like I had to do!

376
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:47,020
Ahh!
Ow!

377
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:52,625
That's right, motherfucker
You're going in that fucking...

378
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:55,795
Dads?

379
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,306
Okay, just...
Just leave her out of it.

380
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,631
What's going on?

381
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:00,143
All right, fuck this.
Time for plan B...

382
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:01,801
If I can't trap you
in a toxic world,

383
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:06,073
I'll just make the whole world
toxic.

384
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:07,440
It's okay, girls.

385
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:09,652
I-I'm so sorry I put us in
danger with some of my behavior.

386
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:12,112
I-If you'd like I can go out
in the g-garden,

387
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:14,747
pick some fresh basil,
and make us a nice Scallopini.

388
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:16,483
What did the booger version
of you mean

389
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:19,219
when he said he was going
to make the whole world toxic?

390
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,289
Believe me, sweetie, that man's
motivations are a mystery.

391
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:24,224
Screw that, Rick.
We got to stop him.

392
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,669
What's the last thing you'd think
about doing with that tank thing?

393
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:28,661
Morty, I appreciate
what you're trying to do,

394
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:30,297
but it's not our place,
you know,

395
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,608
to pick and choose which world
gets saved from what apocalypse.

396
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:35,502
Our... our toxins have as much
a right to their worldview as...

397
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,804
Morty, how is it healthy
to slap me?

398
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:39,072
Obviously my version of health

399
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:40,807
is a hell of a lot different
from yours,

400
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,075
you useless old turd.

401
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:43,343
Wait. That's it.

402
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:45,154
How could that detox machine
know the difference

403
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:48,248
between healthy and sick for
everything that goes through it?

404
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,682
It can't.

405
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:51,594
It must be by the individual's
own definition of toxicity.

406
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:53,186
That means...

407
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,188
Dad! What the...
What the hell, Rick?

408
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:56,189
I'll explain on the way.

409
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:57,824
This "Moon Tower," Morty,

410
00:15:57,857 --> 00:15:59,959
is the perfect height
and metallic composition

411
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:02,095
for the amplification
and beaming of toxic energies.

412
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:03,472
What do you think about that,
Morty?

413
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:04,964
Are you excited about that,
Morty?

414
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:07,834
Oh, man. I'm just freaked out.
I-It's too high up here.

415
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,302
Once I flip this switch,

416
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:11,704
the entire world is gonna
be just as toxic as us, baby.

417
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:20,647
As we praise
our loving Father...

418
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,683
God is a lie!
We made him up for money!

419
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:31,124
Santa Claus isn't real.

420
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:33,893
You were all mistakes!

421
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,663
We fucking did it, Morty.

422
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:38,031
Put your fucking hands
in the air.

423
00:16:38,065 --> 00:16:39,632
Yeah, you little piece of shit.

424
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,501
Remember me?

425
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:44,171
Didn't you learn last time
that you can't beat me?

426
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:46,073
Yeah, I did. And then I learned
something else.

427
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:47,840
- This.
- Ahh!!

428
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:50,243
That bullet is laced with an
encrypted nanobotic virus

429
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:52,979
that will disintegrate your
Morty in about, ah, 20 minutes.

430
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,181
You think I give a shit?

431
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:55,748
I know you give a shit, dummy.

432
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:56,883
Because I know I don't.

433
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,251
Here's another thing I know...

434
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:00,029
The decryption key
that neutralizes the virus.

435
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:01,388
You want it?
Come and get it.

436
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:03,166
Merge with me and you'll know
how to save him.

437
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,857
Pfft. Come on, man.
I've been trapped

438
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:06,602
in your pussy brain
for 70 years of delusions,

439
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:09,596
but this is the all-time weakest
bluff that I've ever...

440
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,531
Ow-Ohh!! Jesus Christ!
What are you doing?!

441
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:13,442
He's cutting your time in half.
10 minutes. Ohh! It hurts!

442
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:14,934
What is your problem?

443
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,770
Oh, I had all my problems
removed... my entitlement,

444
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:19,772
my narcissism,
my crippling loneliness,

445
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:21,274
my irrational attachments.

446
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:23,410
They must be somewhere.
They ain't over here, bro.

447
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:24,777
I'm not going back in there!

448
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:26,413
Honestly,
I don't care either way.

449
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:27,847
I hate having you in me.

450
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,192
And when I say "honestly"
you can believe it,

451
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:30,950
because we both know
I'm too healthy to lie.

452
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,452
Watch.

453
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,430
All right! Knock it off!
You're not impressing anyone.

454
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:36,456
Morty, not that I give
a shit, but are you okay?

455
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,458
Jesus Christ, it hurts.
Relax, quit your bitching.

456
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,727
Y-You're gonna be fine.
Grandpa's here.

457
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,262
You think that's funny?

458
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:44,307
Y-You got to have a sense
of humor about these things.

459
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:45,732
Oh, wait, you can't.

460
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,776
You're literally incapable
of seeing the bigger picture.

461
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,378
I guess it's just funny
because you've never done

462
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,147
anything but complain
about me being in charge,

463
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:53,906
but if I ever gave you the wheel
we'd be dead in five minutes.

464
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,609
- Rick?
- You poor, dumb, sick animal.

465
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:57,644
Rick?

466
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,812
Ahh! Just do it!

467
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:01,748
Just do it, you piece of...

468
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:06,586
I'm back, baby! Regular Rick!
Master of both worlds!

469
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:07,887
Check it it out!

470
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,422
"Excuse me."

471
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:11,991
Now we'll just reverse
this hacky toxicity beam.

472
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,826
Man, I really over think shit
when I'm angry.

473
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:19,166
Oh, give it to me.

474
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,568
Mm, ma-mah.

475
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,437
God is not a lie.

476
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,647
Mommy! Mommy!

477
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:35,848
Ha! All right, Morty,

478
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:37,684
now it's time we re-merge
your little ass.

479
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,027
You're a better man
than me, Rick.

480
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,353
I'm healthy
enough to admit that!

481
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:43,022
That kid
is a real piece of shit.

482
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,133
Y-Y-You're gonna save me,
right?

483
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:46,293
Part of me wanted to,
Toxic Morty.

484
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:49,629
Part of me really wanted to.

485
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,775
I'm telling you,
these shares are hot. Yeah.

486
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,043
That sounds like a good idea.
It's definitely a good idea.

487
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,537
Duane, Duane, Duane, I get it,
now can you get me?

488
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,038
Have I ever lied to you?

489
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:02,475
That's right, and ask around,
I never do, Duane.

490
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:03,876
Let me put this real simple.

491
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,213
This stock is a beautiful
redhead, recently single,

492
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:08,548
not looking to date
but ready to fall in love,

493
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:11,618
and fate has put her locker
two down from yours, Duane...

494
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,353
Two lockers down.

495
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:15,388
So step up or step off, Duane.

496
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:18,258
Blue pill or red pill,
what'll be, bro?

497
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:21,861
Totally understand, Duane.

498
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,530
You're the boss.

499
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:24,964
Heinholz Biotech...

500
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,899
Million and a half
at thirty-three.

501
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:28,868
Heh.

502
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,903
You little fucking monster.

503
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,509
Mmm! Is this organic?

504
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:38,044
Mmm!

505
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:40,680
Go for Morty.

506
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,515
Hi, Morty. It's Jessica.

507
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:44,684
Look, can we just talk
for a minute?

508
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:47,086
Is that how long it takes
for Rick to trace my location?

509
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,489
Come back, Morty.
I miss you.

510
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:50,523
You miss the old me.

511
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:51,867
You miss someone
that loved you so much

512
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:53,159
you never had to love 'em back.

513
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,770
How do you know
I don't want to love you?

514
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:57,096
Because I'm not sick.
Ex-girlfriend?

515
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,666
Should I be jealous? There's
nothing to be jealous of.

516
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,044
I just realized that I'm scheduled
to speak at that fundraiser

517
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:03,603
on our date night.

518
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:06,739
I can cancel. We'll be together.
That's a date.

519
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:08,441
You are the perfect man.

520
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:11,110
Oh, sweetie, I think you hit
the wrong button.

521
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,412
You didn't hang up.

522
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:14,614
Huh. How 'bout that?

523
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:21,120
Sorry, tiny American Psycho,

524
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,290
time to take the opposite
of your medicine.

525
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:26,293
Do what you got to do.

526
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:29,228
Oh! Ow! Ahh!

527
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:31,130
So, how do you feel, Morty?

528
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,766
Ah, geez. I'm miserable.
Am I good or what?

529
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,102
I guess it's worth it, though,
to know how much you care.

530
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:38,805
Care? Me?
Morty, I'm fine with you.

531
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:40,640
I only did this for him.
You lying bitch.

532
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:43,276
She kept coming to our house,
Morty, and kept asking me

533
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,445
"Did... did... d-did you get
a new Morty yet?"

534
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:47,490
Because you kept drunk dialing
me and crying about it.

535
00:20:47,514 --> 00:20:48,715
I wasn't crying!

536
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,049
Jacquelyn, I...

537
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,751
I-I-I wasn't
who I said I was.

538
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:54,220
You weren't a 14-year-old boy
from the Midwest

539
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,423
who ran away from his family
and capitalized

540
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:59,125
on his lack of conscience
by becoming a stock broker?

541
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:01,328
Oh. I guess I was pretty
up front about that, wasn't I?

542
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:03,095
You were up front
about everything.

543
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:04,297
You were my soul mate.

544
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:08,100
Well...
N... Not anymore. I'll, um...

545
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:09,502
Y-You can keep the apartment,

546
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:11,638
and... and... and,
uh... the drones.

547
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:12,839
She can't keep the drones.

548
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:14,116
They turn into
a little Voltron robot.

549
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,174
They're awesome.

550
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:18,511
You can't keep the drones.

551
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,581
So, how was your date with Brad?

552
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,650
It wasn't a date.
We were just having lunch.

553
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:25,461
You guys are getting
back together, aren't you?

554
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:26,862
Morty, I need your help
on an adventure.

555
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:28,287
Eh, "need" is a strong word.

556
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:30,357
We need door stops,
but a brick would work, too.

557
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,525
Okay.

558
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,861
Morty.

559
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:36,563
Good to have you back.

560
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,542
Have you ever been peed on
before?

561
00:21:39,566 --> 00:21:42,369
Oh, my God. Yum.

562
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:45,772
* Hey, did you ever want to hold
a terrifold? *

563
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,674
* I got one right here

564
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:48,975
* Grab my terri-flap

565
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:50,142
* Squeeze it

566
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:51,378
* Grab it, squeeze it

567
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:52,645
* Tug on my terri-flap

568
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:55,114
* Hey, I want to take you to *

569
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,716
* The terrifold dance

570
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:59,852
* Wanna come with me?
You can grab my holdie-folds *

571
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:01,854
* Squeeze 'em tight

572
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:03,222
* You son of a bitch

573
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:05,492
* Suck my holdie-flappy folds

574
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:07,994
* Lick my flappy
foldie-holes *

575
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:10,563
* My terri-flaps
in your mouth *

576
00:22:10,597 --> 00:22:13,299
* Suck my flaps,
you piece of shit *

577
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,868
* Whoo

578
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:18,571
Although only a handful
of moon towers remain today,

579
00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:21,408
they were popular
in the late 19th century.

580
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:23,910
An entire town could be
illuminated by...

581
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:25,412
What the hell is this?

582
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,815
Sea Cucumber!

583
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,217
Sea Cucumber!!
