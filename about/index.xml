      <description>I am a self-employed Data Scientist currently based in Amsterdam. My main area of expertise is digital analytics, however I have worked in a variety of industries such as advertising, aviation and most recently banking. I love solving business problems with data, discovering new insights and building scalable solutions.
While I do have a slight preference for R, I am also familiar with SQL, Python and Apache Spark. I enjoy learning and experimenting with new technologies, which is what this blog is about.</description>
