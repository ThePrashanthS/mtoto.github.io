      <description>I am a self-employed Data Scientist available for consulting on data analytics projects. My main area of expertise is digital analytics, however I have worked on projects in a variety of industries such as online media, e-commerce, travel and banking. I love solving business problems with data, discovering new insights and building scalable solutions.
While I do have a slight preference for R, I am also familiar with SQL, Python and Apache Spark.</description>
